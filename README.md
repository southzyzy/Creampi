### Home Management V1 - Introduction
What we will end up with is a simple home monitoring system.

> * It tracks basic temperature/humidity values and display then accordingly on the webapplication.
> * It also turns on an LED based on the light values of the room, this is done to save power.
> * When a postman or a visitor arrives at the door, he/she can press the doorbell of the apartment that they are here for and the home owner will be alerted, they then can send a short message and it will be shown on a LCD screen at the door for the visitor.
> * Making use of AWS Polly, we will be able to convert the text into speech so that the visitors can have also have an audio feedback from the home owner.
> * The webapp is there for the home owner to monitor their home statistics, a live webcam service is also available using the motion server.

Without further ado, lets find out how we can accomplish all these things!
